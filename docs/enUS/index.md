:::warning
This site uses a lot of high-resolution images, and if you are using mobile data or other pay-per-traffic services that are more expensive, then I don't recommend browsing this site with the images loaded by default, as doing so may consume a lot of your bandwidth.
:::

:::warning
Since Starcloudsea's English is very poor, the vast majority of the site has been translated by DeepL, so if you think there's a mistake in some parts of the translation, please leave a comment here or mention an issue on GitHub! awa

English pages are missing a lot of content compared to Chinese pages.
